# Morning Struggle
Project Description
"Morning Struggle" is a short movie encapsulating the daily challenges faced by a college student every morning. This narrative is ingeniously depicted through a website that employs a comic style and aesthetic, aiming to present a light-hearted yet relatable story. The project delves into the quintessential conflict faced by students: the choice between succumbing to the comfort of their beds and risking their attendance grades or battling sleepiness to attend class. Through an engaging mix of anecdotes and poem-like quotes, the website seeks to resonate with its audience, emphasizing the reality of the morning struggle.

# Process
The creation of the "Morning Struggle" website involved the use of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to craft an immersive storytelling experience. The narrative unfolds linearly, with a scrolling mechanism that reveals a sequence of events, each correlating with the next to maintain a coherent story flow. Key features of the website include:

**Embedded Video:**A central iframe hosts a video link to our short movie, produced during a class project. JavaScript controls ensure smooth playback and navigation, including slideshow functionality and video play/pause options.
**Behind the Scenes:** A sliding carousel section allows users to explore behind-the-scenes images. This interactive feature enables users to slide images left and right, offering a glimpse into the project's creation.

# Reflection/Evaluation
The initial conception of the website took a different direction, initially lacking in storytelling elements and quickly becoming overly complex. A pivot to the current comic-style sequential storytelling approach marked a significant improvement, simplifying the narrative while enhancing engagement. Although there is potential for further enhancements through additional content and interactive elements, the primary objective of conveying the morning challenges of a college student was successfully met. This project stands as a testament to the creative exploration and iterative design process, highlighting both the struggle and the achievements involved in bringing "Morning Struggle" to life.

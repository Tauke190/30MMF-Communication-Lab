# Morning Struggle
Project Description
"Morning Struggle" is a short movie encapsulating the daily challenges faced by a college student every morning. This narrative is ingeniously depicted through a website that employs a comic style and aesthetic, aiming to present a light-hearted yet relatable story. The project delves into the quintessential conflict faced by students: the choice between succumbing to the comfort of their beds and risking their attendance grades or battling sleepiness to attend class. Through an engaging mix of anecdotes and poem-like quotes, the website seeks to resonate with its audience, emphasizing the reality of the morning struggle.
The website consists of interactive elements of image carousel. It also contains a timer which is a dynamic content that undergoes a transformation, a basic scale animation that grows and shrinks rhythmically, visually echoing the heartbeat of passing moments to signify the urgency of time.

# Process
The creation of the "Morning Struggle" website involved the use of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to craft an immersive storytelling experience. The narrative unfolds linearly, with a scrolling mechanism that reveals a sequence of events, each correlating with the next to maintain a coherent story flow. Key features of the website include:

**Timer**: I also added a timer that has a basic scale animation that depicts the urgency of the time to students. So, I used a javascript function called setInterval which calls the function updateClock every interval time given as parameters. In this case, it is 1 sec. In the updateClock, it gets the date from the system and updates the text content by directly modifying the CSS property of the text content.

**Embedded Video:** A central iframe hosts a video link to our short movie, produced during a class project. JavaScript controls ensure smooth playback and navigation, including slideshow functionality and video play/pause options.The togglePlay function controls the playback of a video and the visibility of a play button: if the video is paused, it starts playing and hides the play button; if it's playing, it pauses and shows the play button. Additionally, event listeners for the play and pause events on the video element automatically hide or show the play button, ensuring the button's visibility matches the video's state.

**Behind the Scenes:** A sliding carousel section allows users to explore behind-the-scenes images. This interactive feature enables users to slide images left and right, offering a glimpse into the project's creation. The showSlides function manages the visibility of slides in a carousel by hiding all slides and then displaying only the one specified by the index n. If n exceeds the range of available slides, it loops to the start or end, ensuring continuous navigation. It utilizes the display CSS property to hide (set to "none") or show (set to "block") slides.

# Reflection/Evaluation
The initial conception of the website took a different direction, initially lacking in storytelling elements and quickly becoming overly complex. A pivot to the current comic-style sequential storytelling approach marked a significant improvement, simplifying the narrative while enhancing engagement. Although there is potential for further enhancements through additional content and interactive elements, the primary objective of conveying the morning challenges of a college student was successfully met. This project stands as a testament to the creative exploration and iterative design process, highlighting both the struggle and the achievements involved in bringing "Morning Struggle" to life.
